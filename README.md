# Sudoku-Solver
A simple Sudoku solver console application that uses backtracking method and recursion to recursively fill in the 
empty cells in the game board and solve the game. 

# What I Learned
* Recursion, how a function can be called back within its definition in a loop until a solution is found to be true.
* Backtracking, how the backtracking method can be combined with recursion to repeatedly test new guesses until it becomes true.
* Data Structures, working and manipulating a common data structure.
